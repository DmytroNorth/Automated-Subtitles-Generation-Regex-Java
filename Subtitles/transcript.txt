[Traumatic] brain injuries are extremely debilitating for most people.

In our practice,
we see many brain injuries

that have resulted from falls
and motor vehicle accidents.

Unlike a (broken) arm or a broken leg
oftentimes the brain injury

cannot be seen objectively
on imaging such as C.T. scans or M.R.Is,

and therefore they are oftentimes
not taken seriously.

They should be.
Because a Mr. Smith can be devastating.

Brain injuries are essentially divided
into three types:

mild, moderate and severe.

Even a mild brain injury
can have a very significant impact

on a person's life.

Particularly if their job is one
where they're dealing with,

for example, dense scientific matters
or other complex matters.

A mild or moderate brain injury will
often not be seen on a CT scan or an MRI.

However, we often prove the existence
of a brain injury,

not only through the symptoms
observed by a physician, a neurologist,

but also by doing neuropsychological
testing.

We hire a neuropsychologist
to do a battery of tests,

which can often last a day or two
and can be quite exhausting for a client.

The neuropsychologist can not only
provide an opinion as to

whether the person has a brain injury,
but also what the impact

of that injury is on the person's
cognition, memory, word finding,

executive function, multitasking, etc.

And also the impact that those
deficiencies have on that person's job

and ability to earn income.

Traumatic brain injuries are oftentimes,
very subtle, yet devastating injuries

that require experts that we hire
in order to assess precisely

what the injury is and the impact
of that traumatic brain injury.
